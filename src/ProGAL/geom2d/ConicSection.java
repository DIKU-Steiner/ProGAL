/**
The general equation for all conic sections is Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2+ Dx + Ey +F = 0
 
If B^2-4AC < 0, then the curve is an ellipse, circle, point, or no curve
If B^2-4AC = 0, then the curve is parabola, 2 parallel lines, 1 line, or no curve
If B^2-4AC > 0, then the curve is a hyperbola or 2 intersecting lines.
