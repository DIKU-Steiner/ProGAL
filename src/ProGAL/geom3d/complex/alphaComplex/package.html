	An alpha complex for a set of d-dimensional points and a real number alpha is a subset of the Delaunay complex 
	where all simplices that can be enclosed by an alpha-probe (a hypersphere of radius alpha), without the probe 
	enclosing any points, are removed.

   This package contains classes that are related to building and representing three-dimensional alpha complexes.
