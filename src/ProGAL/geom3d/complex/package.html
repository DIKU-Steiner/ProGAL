	A simplicial complex is a topological space of a particular kind, constructed by "gluing together" points, 
	line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts. [Wikipedia]

   This package contains classes that are all related to three-dimensional simplicial complexes. The specific types of 
   complexes (such as the Delaunay-complex) are implemented in their own sub-packages. All specific complexes use the 
   CVertex, CEdge, CTriangle and CTetrahedron classes as the basic datastructure. It is possible to navigate entire 
   components of a complex from any member of the complex. For instance a breadth-first-search from any edge can collect 
   all tetrahedra in that component. The relevant methods for traversing a complex are:
   <table>
   <tr><td>Going down in simplicial complexity</td><td>Going up in simplicial complexity</td></tr>
   <tr><td>CVertex  	</td><td>-								</td><td>List<CEdge> getAdjacentEdges()         		</td></tr>
   <tr><td>CEdge    	</td><td>CVertex getPoint(int i)		</td><td>List<CTriangle> getAdjacentTriangles()     	</td></tr>
   <tr><td>CTriangle	</td><td>CEdge getEdge(int i) 			</td><td>CTetrahedron getNeighbor(int i) 				</td></tr>
   <tr><td>CTetrahedron	</td><td>CTriangle getTriangle(int i)	</td><td>(CTetrahedron getNeighbor(int i))				</td></tr>
   </table>
